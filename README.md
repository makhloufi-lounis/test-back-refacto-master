# Refactoring Kata Test

##  Refactoring process :

1. Modification of the properties visibility of all entities in private.

2. Add getters and setters for all entities. 

3. Adaptations of the code of the different classes and files in relation to the change of entities so that the project works again.

4. Correction of unit tests.

5. Refactoring class TemplateManager : refactoring of the class test by distributing the code of the computeText function over several functions while eliminating the code which seemed to me useless to make the class more understandable and easy to update.

6. Update of unit tests.
